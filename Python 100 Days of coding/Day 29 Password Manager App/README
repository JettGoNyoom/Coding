Building an app called "My Pass" to store and generate passwords
- Provide name of website so we know what the password is for
- input email/username
- come up with a password or generate password
- Add the credentials to a text file locally
- if you click "add" with any empty fields, a popup points it out
- generating a password immediately copies the generated password into clipboard for immediate pasting to another field
